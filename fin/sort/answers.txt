sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The sorting is nearly instant when the words are sorted. Bubble sort is the only sorting
method that checks if any swaps must occur through the entire list, and, if not, ends early.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: The sorting is by far the quickest, except losing to sort1 when the numbers are in order,
and it is consistent no matter the order. Merge sort always breaks the order down into pairs, compares
each pair, and then combines pairs. This causes the sorting to be consistently the same speed, as it always
does just as many checks.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The sorting is consistent, but slower than sort2. Selection sort must check for the smallest
number through each iteration, and never checks for completeness through each iteration. It only compares
that to the first number it knows is sorted. Therefore, it is consistent, but it is slower than merge sorting.
